SerialMail
==========================

This is a simple and plain text serial mailer for AppleScript

What you need is two text files: One contains the addresses with a single address per line. The other contains your mail content as plain text. Once you run the script, you will be prompted to choose first the address file, then the content file. Be careful though, some part of my Mail.app or the AppleScript couldnâ€™t handle more than about 1200 addresses at once, so you should play it safe and divide the address files to contain only about 800 mail addresses. Have fun!
